# Python assignment/semister 1
Mini python project for my university python class(Introduction to Computers).

The aim of these 4 little projects was to learn how to use lists,dictionaries,files,etc. as well as how to access and edit their data,basically through looping.


Excercise 9:
Write a code in Python that takes as input an ASCII text file and converts each character to the corresponding ASCII number and keeps the odd ones. Display the occurrence statistics of each letter with “bars” using the * character, where each * corresponds to 1%. Rounding will be done upwards.
A: **********
C: ***
E: **************
G: **


Excercise 11:
Write a code in Python that takes as input a dictionary from a file. The dictionary can also contain other dictionaries, lists, etc. Show the user the keys that appear most often, also checking the nested dictionaries.

{"results":[{"x":5} ,{"x":5,"y":[1,2,3]},{"x":5,"y":{"a": 2,"b":67}}]}
    =>Most popular key is x


Excercise 12:
Write a code in Python that takes as input an ASCII text file and converts each character to the "mirror" of the ASCII character. Mirror characters are those whose sum is 128. Display the mirror text to the user in reverse character order.

Excercise 13:
Write a code in Python that takes as input an ASCII text file, splits it into words, and displays the pairs of words where their total character length is exactly 20. Each pair leaves the set, and the program ends when the pairs are exhausted.
For the text "Tale of two cities" found in the documents, sample words left by length: '12': [], '10': [], '15': [], '13': [], ' 11': [], '14': [], '16': [], '18': [], '19': [], '17': [], '20': ['carriagedoortenderly', 'thingnothingstartles']
